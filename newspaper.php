        If you are interested in writing an article for the Newspaper, keep these things in mind:<br />
        Articles must be at least a pargraph long.<br />
        Articles can be about real events in GRPG (such as a new feature being added, or a strong gang) or just about life in Generica (So I was walking down the road with my gramma yesterday, and out of nowhere this guy walks up and steals her purse from her!)<br />
        Articles may be rejected for any reason at all.<br />
        As soon as you submit an article, you no longer have any rights over that article, it becomes the sole property of Brandon Werner (me)<br />
        You will get your name credited at the top of the article<br /><br />
        To send an article, either PM it to Publius with the subject "Newspaper Article", or send an email to myneocorp@gmail.com with the subject "Newspaper Article".
