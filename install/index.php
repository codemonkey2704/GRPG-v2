    <p>
		Over the next few steps, you're going to install gRPG: PDO.<br />
		Seeing as you're probably reading this from a browser, I'm going to assume that you've already uploaded all files and have read the steps in the README to reach this place - if not, <strong>go read them now!</strong><br /><br />
		Most of the info you're about to fill in can be easily changed in-game. The database configuration settings, however, require you to edit <code>/.env</code> - this installer does that for you.<br /><br />
		Don't worry too much, the installer's requirements speak for themselves as you reach them (minus the obvious ones!)
	</p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead">Ready to get started?</h2>
	<p>
		Simply click on "Install" on the left-hand menu!
